Different Excel projects that I have worked on with great findings!
Started by collecting datasets from reliable data sources after which I proceeded to clean out the data which involves data formatting, removing blanks, duplicates, etc. Performed some functions and calculations while exploring information that is necessary for analysis. 
Created reports on the key findings and insights using charts and graphs - Data visualization.
I hope you enjoy reviewing my work and drop a feedback if any ðŸ˜Š
